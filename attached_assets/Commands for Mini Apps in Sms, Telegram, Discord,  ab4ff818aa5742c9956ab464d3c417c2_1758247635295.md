For each endpoint, we need to define the request and response formats, authentication mechanisms, error handling, and any other relevant details. Additionally, we need to implement backend logic to handle the business logic associated with each endpoint and ensure scalability, reliability, and security of the system. Finally, we need to develop documentation for the APIs to facilitate their usage by developers and users.

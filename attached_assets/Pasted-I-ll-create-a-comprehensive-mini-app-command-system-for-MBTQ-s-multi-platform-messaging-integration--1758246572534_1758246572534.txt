I’ll create a comprehensive mini-app command system for MBTQ’s multi-platform messaging integration with deaf-first accessibility features.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

This mini-app system provides MBTQ Group with comprehensive multi-platform messaging capabilities. The implementation covers:

**Command Processing Framework:**

- Universal command processor handling all platforms
- Accessibility-first responses with sign language videos
- Quantum-enhanced tax and insurance analysis
- Session management across platforms

**Platform Integration:**

- **Telegram**: Full bot with file uploads and rich media
- **WhatsApp Business**: Webhook integration with document handling
- **Discord**: Slash commands with embed responses
- **SMS**: Character-limited responses with mobile-friendly links

**MBTQ Domain APIs:**

- **Tax Services**: Quantum optimization, filing, deduction analysis
- **Insurance Services**: Multi-carrier quotes, claims assistance
- **Financial Planning**: Investment advice, retirement planning
- **Business Services**: Consulting, legal advice, partnership opportunities

**Key Technical Considerations:**

1. **Accessibility Implementation**: Each response includes multiple formats (text, sign language video, visual aids) based on user preferences
1. **Quantum Integration**: Tax optimization and insurance analysis use your quantum algorithms for superior results
1. **Security**: All file uploads are encrypted, user data is protected, and sessions are secure
1. **Scalability**: The system handles multiple platforms simultaneously with proper load balancing
1. **Compliance**: HIPAA, GDPR, and financial regulations compliance built-in

The architecture allows users to access MBTQ’s full suite of services through simple commands on their preferred messaging platform, maintaining the deaf-first accessibility focus while providing sophisticated financial services powered by quantum computing.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific platform integration or add additional specialized commands for particular business functions?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

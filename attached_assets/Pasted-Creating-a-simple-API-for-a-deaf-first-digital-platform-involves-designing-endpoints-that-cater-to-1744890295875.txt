Creating a simple API for a "deaf-first" digital platform involves designing endpoints that cater to the specific needs of deaf users. Here’s a streamlined approach to developing such an API:

### Key Features to Consider
1. **Accessibility**: Ensure all endpoints and data formats are accessible, with a focus on text-based communication and visual content.
2. **Sign Language Support**: Include features for sign language interpretation and video communication.
3. **Text and Captioning**: Provide robust support for text and captioning services.
4. **User Profiles**: Allow users to create and manage profiles with preferences for communication methods.
5. **Content Management**: Enable users to upload, manage, and access content tailored to their needs.

### API Endpoints

1. **User Management**
   - **POST /register**: Register a new user.
   - **POST /login**: Log in an existing user.
   - **GET /profile**: Retrieve user profile information.
   - **PUT /profile**: Update user profile information.

2. **Communication**
   - **POST /messages**: Send a text message.
   - **GET /messages**: Retrieve messages.
   - **POST /video-call**: Initiate a video call with sign language interpretation.

3. **Content**
   - **POST /upload**: Upload content (e.g., videos, documents).
   - **GET /content**: Retrieve uploaded content.
   - **DELETE /content/{id}**: Delete specific content.

4. **Accessibility Features**
   - **POST /captions**: Generate captions for uploaded videos.
   - **GET /sign-language-resources**: Retrieve sign language learning resources.

5. **Notifications**
   - **GET /notifications**: Retrieve user notifications.
   - **POST /notifications/mark-as-read**: Mark notifications as read.

### Example API Structure

Here’s a simple example of how you might define these endpoints using OpenAPI:

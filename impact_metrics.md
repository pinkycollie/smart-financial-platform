## Social Return on Investment (SROI) Calculation

We calculate the social return on investment using the following methodology:

1. **Quantified Financial Benefits**:
   - Direct tax savings
   - Insurance premium reductions
   - Fee savings from accessible services
   - Time value of streamlined processes

2. **Projected Quality of Life Improvements**:
   - Reduced financial stress (research-backed valuation)
   - Increased financial confidence (survey-based metrics)
   - Career and business opportunity expansion

3. **SROI Formula**:
   ```
   SROI = (Total Value of Outcomes) / (Total Value of Inputs)
   ```

Based on pilot data, we project an SROI of 4.2:1 over a three-year period, meaning every dollar invested in DEAF FIRST generates $4.20 in social and economic value for the deaf community.
